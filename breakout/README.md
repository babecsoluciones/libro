# Jquery Breakout
JQuery Breakout is a re-creation of a classic Atari arcade game using HTML, Canvas, CSS, and JQuery. 
This project was conceptualized and created over a one week development sprint and served as my first foray into game physics 
and HTML audio. You can visit the live site here: http://donnellstrom.com/Breakout-JQuery/.
